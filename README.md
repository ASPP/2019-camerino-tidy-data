These notebooks were created for the Melbourne Bioinformatics workshops on Data tidying with Python and Pandas, and Data visualisation with Python. They are based in part on a visualisation workshop I created for the Advanced Scientific Programming in Python summer school.

For the Data tidying with Python and Pandas workshop, we will use the Pandas_and_tidying.ipynb notebook.

For the Data visualisation with Python workshop, we will use the notebooks Seaborn_Matplotlib.ipynb and Altair.ipynb .

To launch Jupyter Notebook in your browser via Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/claresloggett/data_tidying_and_visualisation/master)

Remember that if you work in Binder, you should download any edited notebook that you want to keep.
